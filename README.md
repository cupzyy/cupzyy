# CUPZYY
I am a self taught developer from Norway. I make stuff I think is cool. I love solving non-trivial technical problems.

##  🔭 Cool things I have made:
- [A solver for NRK's "Former"](https://github.com/cupzyy/former-solver): A C++ application solving NRK's game: "Former" using the Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) algorithm. This was my first C++-project.
- [Discordmedia.me](https://github.com/cupzyy/discordmedia.me): A first of it's kind web-application to get around discord's size limitation on videos, with the ability to upload even huge movies, without needing huge disks when hosting. The website automatically generates "embedable" and short urls.
- [National Student Championship (Skole-NM: IT-utvikling)](https://github.com/NM-Tangen-2025/NM-Elvebakken-ArneHabrekke): National finals project, 3rd place nationally, Oslos representative.
- [Rekkopp.io (public preview)](https://github.com/cupzyy/rekkopp.io-preview): A digital hand-raising and queue management system for classrooms, focusing on real-time coordination between teachers and students.
